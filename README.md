# Javascript Quiz
This is a quiz page that I've made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Phase one was to get the basic quiz working. After that I got as many bells and whistles added as possible. Currently the quiz runs, keeps score, has a basic timer, and ends. It has 7 questions but more can be added by adding to the QnArray.

This is just an HTML file, a CSS file, a javascript file, and an image files. No installation is required.

## Usage
WIP

## Contributing
Please contact me if you have any suggestions. Either things that need to be changed or removed, or elements that need to be added.

If you think it should be scrapped and started over from scratch you could suggest that too, but it wouldn't be very helpful without telling me exactly why it doesn't work.

## Current iteration
At this point the quiz is in the Beta Phase.
The quiz runs, tallies score, has a basic timer, and ends as expected. Currently there is no high score option.

## Future Development Plans
Add aesthetic styling.
Have score relate to timer.
Have incorrect answers penalize timer.
Have correct answers add to timer.
Add high score section.
