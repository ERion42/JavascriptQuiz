# Javascript Quiz
This is a quiz page that I've made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Phase one is to get the basic quiz working. After that I'll be adding all the bells and whistles.

## Installation
This is just an HTML file, a CSS file, a javascript file, and an image files. No installation is required.

## Usage
WIP

## Contributing
Please contact me if you have any suggestions. Either things that need to be changed or removed, or elements that need to be added.

If you think it should be scrapped and started over from scratch you could suggest that too, but it wouldn't be very helpful without telling me exactly why it doesn't work.

## Current iteration
Still currently in intial build phase. It's just a little past a skeleton at this point.
The quiz runs, tallies score, and ends as expected. Currently there is no timer, nor is there a high score option.

## Future Development Plans
Finish the assignment.
