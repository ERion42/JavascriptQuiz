WIP

## Contributing
Please contact me if you have any suggestions. Either things that need to be changed or removed, or elements that need to be added.

If you think it should be scrapped and started over from scratch you could suggest that too, but it wouldn't be very helpful without telling me exactly why it doesn't work.

## Current iteration
Still currently in intial build phase. Working on the skeleton of the site.

## Future Development Plans
Finish the assignment.
